# replay-recorder

Program that captures user activity, such as:

- Keypresses
- Changes to the foreground window (e.g., when you alt-tab to another program)

**Note:** Only supports Windows machines.

## What's it for?

The recordings (`.txt` files produced by the recorder) can be fed to LLMs and queried for a summary of your activity.

Basically, it's a light-weight version of Microsoft Recall. However, since it's open-source, you can run everything locally and avoid sending your data to an LLM in the cloud.
